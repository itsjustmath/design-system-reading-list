# A Design System Reading List

*Inspired by David Clark's [Scalable CSS Reading List](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scalable-css-reading-list).*

Some people call them **style guides**, others call them **pattern libraries**. I've taken a cue from [Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608) and named them **design systems**.

> A *style guide* is an artifact of design process. A *design system* is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem.

I want this list to provide resources that facilitate cross-functional collaboration within an organization, allowing stakeholders to focus on delivering the best possible user experience.

## What is a Design System?

Mark Otto [described](https://speakerdeck.com/mdo/build-your-own-bootstrap?slide=16) a design system as “everything that makes up your product”.

*Everything*? **Everything**. From typography, layouts and grids, colors, icons, components and coding conventions, to voice and tone, style-guide and documentation, a design system is bringing all of these together in a way that allows your entire team to learn, build, and grow. [*](https://css-tricks.com/design-systems-building-future/) 

A design system is a definition of the architecture, content, visual, and supporting assets and templates to produce and/or sustain a consistent and effective product experience.[*](http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2011/05/10/what-is-a-design-system/)
