# A Design System Reading List

*Inspired by David Clark's [Scalable CSS Reading List](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scalable-css-reading-list).*

A list of things to read or watch that address these two questions: **What are design systems** and **how do we create design systems**?

## Design Systems

> A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem. ([Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608))
