# A Design System Reading List [^scallable]

*Inspired by David Clark's [Scalable CSS Reading List](https://github.com/davidtheclark/scalable-css-reading-list).*

## Intro

**What is a design system?**

Mark Otto [described](https://speakerdeck.com/mdo/build-your-own-bootstrap?slide=16) a design system as “everything that makes up your product”.

Everything? Everything. From typography, layouts and grids, colors, icons, components and coding conventions, to voice and tone, style-guide and documentation, a design system is bringing all of these together in a way that allows your entire team to learn, build, and grow. [*](https://css-tricks.com/design-systems-building-future/)

Some people call them style guides, others call them pattern libraries. I've taken a cue from [Nathan Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608) and named them design systems.

> A **style guide** is an artifact of design process. A **design system** is a living, funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem.

The goal of these systems are to provide clear direction and ensure consistency in the design and development process. This documentation is invaluable when maintaining a brand identity over time, particularly when more than one person is producing material. [*](https://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/)
